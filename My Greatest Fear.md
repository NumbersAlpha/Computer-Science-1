My Greatest Fear

BUGS
while bugs have been on my mind for a while now, they've also been in my backyard. 
Finding bugs in your house, of course, is a tragedy in itself, but the fear that they'll crawl up your leg, up your arm, and the tingling sensation too.
It's too much, having a bug unexpectedly crawling up a limb. Especially unexpectedly, not knowing what's tickling your leg makes me want to slap it off.
The fright felt when that happens is tremendous, I might not like dark alleys too. super exaggerated
