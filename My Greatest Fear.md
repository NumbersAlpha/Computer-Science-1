# "My Greatest Fear.md"

## **BUGS**, Who and Why?

I'm Ethan and my greatest fear seems to be bugs,

<sub>While bugs have been on my mind for a while now, they've also been in my backyard. 
Finding bugs in your house, of course, is a tragedy in itself, but the fear that they'll crawl up your leg, up your arm, and the tingling sensation too.
It's too much, having a bug unexpectedly crawling up your limb. Especially unexpectedly, not knowing what's tickling your leg makes me want to slap it off even more.
The fright felt when that happens is tremendous, I might not like dark alleys too. <sub>
  
<sub>The ***next level*** is when they fly into your ear, like, what can you even do about that? You can't delicately pull it out while reacting as quickly as possible.
You know, if bugs wanted to, they could probably live in your ear for the rest of your life; have a family in there. **You know how terrifying that is?**
Multiple generations of bug families festering in your ear. I saw this one video of a women getting a spider out of their ear, absolutely horrendous.

<sub>I wonder how motorcyclists feel without wearing a helmet. That must be brutal if they didn't like bugs like I do. Don't? 
Bugs are fine. If they can respect my distance and not attach themselves to me like all the mosquitoes do, while also reading my mind to say that I don't want them unexpectedly in places that I wouldn't want them to be, I hate ticks, Then we can live with our differences. But for now, any bug that doesn't have my consent may get a slappin from my hand on my body.<sub>

<sub>As you can see, bugs and I don't get along. It's been like this since time began, the little critters sipping on the larger ones; in whatever way you take that.
Don't even get me started on the microorganisms living on your face and their great great great great.. couple more greats of grandmother and fathers dying, living
reproducing on your face at this very moment. Nah it doesn't bother me.<sub>

Super exaggerated explaination of why I'm afraid of bugs.
